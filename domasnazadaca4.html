        <p>
            The name of Prilep appeared first as Πρίλαπος' in Greek (Prilapos) in 1014, 
            and was mentioned by John Skylitzes as the place where Samuel of Bulgaria had died after the Battle of Kleidion.
             The town was attached literally to the rocky hilltop above, and its name derives from Old Slavic, 
            and means “stuck on the rock”.

            Tobacco is one of Prilep's traditional cash crops and prospers in the Macedonian climate. Many of the world's largest cigarette makers,
             such as Marlboro, West and Camel use Prilep's tobacco in their cigarettes after
              it is processed in local factories such as Tutunski kombinat Prilep. 
              A Tobacco Institute is established in the city in order to produce new types of tobacco and
               it was the first example of applying genetics to agriculture in the Balkans.

        <p id="orangetext">
            In antiquity, the region of Prilep was part of ancient Pelagonia that was inhabited by the Pelagones, an ancient Greek tribe of Upper Macedonia,
             who according to Strabo,[5] were Epirote Molossians.
            The region was annexed to the Macedonian kingdom during the 4th century BC. In September 2007 archeological excavations in Bonče,
             revealed a tomb of what is believed to be the burial site of a Macedonian ruler dating 4th century BC.
