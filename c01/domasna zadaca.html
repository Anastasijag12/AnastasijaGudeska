            The name of Prilep appeared first as Πρίλαπος' in Greek (Prilapos) in 1014, and was mentioned
            by <a href>John Skylitzes</a> as the place where <a href>Samuel of Bulgaria</a> had died after the <a href>Battle of Kleidion</a>. 
            The town was attached literally to the rocky hilltop above, 
            and its name derives from <a href>Old Slavic</a>, and means “stuck on the rock”.
